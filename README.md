　　When you press escape button in game, the pause menu will pop up. There’s resume button to continue the game. Restart button to restart the game. Menu button to return to main menu.

#Bonus:

2.	Obstacles: There’s not only crossbar but also some small fences to block some part of the route.

#Feedback:
    I have never learned unity before, so there are so many features in unity I had to learn and figure them out by myself. Therefore, it’s so time-consuming for me compared to other homework in the class. In conclusion, even though I spent quite a long time in the game, I have learned some basics and special features in unity that are not mentioned in class. So I think it’s worth it.
